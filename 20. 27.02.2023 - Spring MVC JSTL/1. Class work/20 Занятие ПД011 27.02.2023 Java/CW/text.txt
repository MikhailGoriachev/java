3. XML Configuration
If we need to go the old fashion way with XML-based configuration, we can make good 
use of the mvc:resources element to point to the location of resources with a specific 
public URL pattern.

For example, the following line will serve all requests for resources coming 
in with a public URL pattern, like “/resources/**”, by searching in the “/resources/” 
directory under the root folder in our application:

<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/" />

Now we can access a CSS file like in the following HTML page:

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<html>
<head>
    <link href="<c:url value="/resources/myCss.css" />" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
